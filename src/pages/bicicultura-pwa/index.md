# Context
Bicicultura is the biggest event about cycling culture in Brazil, and is hold every year in a different city. The event aims to bring together discussions and workshops on the diverse theme of urban mobility, touching the cultural, social, political, artistic, economic and environmental. It's organized by UCB, the biggest organization on ciclism in the country, and is helped by local groups. 

In the past year the event was held in Recife, which I had the pleasure to be invitied to present my project [bike de boa](https://Raimundo Carlos LaguÃ­adalbem.com/bike-de-boa/). In 2018 it'd be held in Rio de Janeiro, the city where I just moved to, and I really wanted to help with it. The Transporte Ativo organization and its founder ZÃ© Lobo are highly influential in the cicloativism scene and I was fortunate to know them already from a previous partnership.


# The problem
The idea of developing an app for the event appeared from chatting with the organization and seemed like a great opportunity for using my skills to help them. The official website was a simple Wordpress page.

There were budget limitations for improving the website, but the most critical part is that they wouldn't be able to afford even printing the schedule to offer the participants. Their solution was to provide a link to download a PDF of that same website version, which didn't help a lot.

# Development

## Planning

Talking with ZÃ© Lobo we decided the main objective of the app would be to improve the experience for the event participants on checking the schedule. This task would need to be supported either for users in their desktops, when they are at home planning the visit, but mainly in the mobile case, when checking the schedule during the event. An offline experience would be critical as well, since the Museum didn't have wi-fi and many brazilians can't afford decent 3G plans.

In the benchmarking phase I looked for mainly two things:

* apps that are specialized in events
* how some of my favorite events made their apps

This phase highlighted some common UI patterns event apps use and gave me cool ideas for improving the attendees' experience. Everything was logged in a simple Trello board.

## Technology
Since I didn't have much time available for the project and I was the only developer and designer I needed to be very mindful of the technologic solutions, priorizing powerful frameworks that could give me ready-to-use solutions.

The natural choice for me was to build PWA (Progressive Web App). Not only I'm very used to web technologies, but being a PWA I could offer everything a native app without the need to develop the same solution multiple times. The main advantages of a PWA I would be leveraging would be:

* Offline support
* Ability to add the app to the home screen
* Full screen experience (no address bar)
* Cross-platform and cross-device with a single source code.

```  

Today the easiest way to develop a simple PWA is using React. It has a vibrant community that develops open-source tools that I could reuse, like the `create-react-act` boilerplate for automating everything about the project scaffolding and build configs.

For the UI I chose to use [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/), a popular React UI lib that implements the Material Design System. An unique visual identity was not much of a priority, and users would be using this app for the first time and only for a few days, so it was interesting to employ the Material well-known patterns and visual style to reduce cognitive load of understanding the app. Still, some very basic customization was done mainly with the Typography and Color Pallete to mirror the event visual identity.

# Results

The app was highlighted in all the major event communications, both digital and physical, which was super important for reaching the target audience. I was delighted to see people using the app on their phones all the time during the event. I even caught one or two suggesting the app to others that were still checking the old PDF schedule in their small phone screens.

        "app installs": "32"
    }'>

Another cool result from this project was the front-end performance. By using modern technologies and leveraging the best tools I could find the implemented solution got really good grades in the [Google Lighthouse Audit](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) (to be honest, not that hard for such a simple app ðŸ¤“).

# Further work

I didn't have the opportunity to implement several cool ideas from the backlog, which will be perhaps left to next year's event.

Another thing I pretend to work someday is to generalize how the event schedule is configured, so people can easily use it for their own events.
